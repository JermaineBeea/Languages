To run this code, you need to compile it with Cython. Here's a basic example of how you can do this:

Save your code in a .pyx file, for example filterfunc.pyx.
**Create a setup.py file in the same directory with the following content:**
**CREATE A FILE NAMED FILENAME.PYX AND EMBED NAME TO TO SETUP FILE**

SETUPFILE
from setuptools import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    ext_modules = cythonize("FILENAME.pyx")->IMBEDDED FILENAME
)

Run the following command in your terminal: python setup.py build_ext --inplace
