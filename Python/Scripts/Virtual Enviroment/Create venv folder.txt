To get the current exchange rate between two currencies such as 'USD' and 'EUR', you can use the 'requests' library in Python to send a GET request to a currency exchange API. Here's an example using the 'exchangerate-api':

```python
import requests

def get_current_exchange_rate(base_currency, target_currency):
    api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  # replace with your actual

 API

 key
    url = f'https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/{api_key}/latest/{base_currency}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return data['conversion_rates'][target_currency]

rate = get_current_exchange_rate('USD', 'EUR')
print(rate)
```

Please note that you need to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key from 'exchangerate-api'. You can get a free API key by signing up on their website.

This script will print the current exchange rate from USD to EUR. The data is returned in JSON format.

Also, remember to handle potential exceptions that might occur while making the HTTP request.
