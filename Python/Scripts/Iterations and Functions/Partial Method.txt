The partial function from the functools module in Python allows you to create a new version of a function with some arguments fixed (i.e., pre-set). This is especially useful in cases where a function takes multiple arguments, but you want to supply only some of them while delaying others for later.
Basic Explanation of partial

    It allows you to "partially apply" a function by pre-setting some of its arguments.
    The returned function can be called later with the remaining arguments.

Example of partial in Use

In your specific case, you want each button to call button1 with a different argument n, but you donâ€™t want to call button1 immediately when creating the buttons. The partial function helps by creating a callable that "remembers" the value of n and waits to be called by the button's command later.
