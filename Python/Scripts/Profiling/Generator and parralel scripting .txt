Use a generator: In Python, a generator is a type of iterable, like a list or a tuple. Unlike lists, however, generators don't store all their values in memory; they generate them on the fly. This can be a more memory-efficient way to handle large amounts of data. Here's how you could use a generator to generate your forecasts:

def generate_forecasts(num_forecasts):
    for _ in range(num_forecasts):
        yield forecast()
forecasts = generate_forecasts(num_forecasts)

def count_up_to(n):
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        yield i
        i += 1
# Create a generator
counter = count_up_to(5)
# Iterate over the generator
for number in counter:
    print(number)

In this code, `generate_forecasts` is a generator function that yields a new forecast each time it's iterated over. You can loop over `forecasts` just like a list to get each forecast, but the forecasts aren't actually generated until you do so.
________________________________
 **Parallelize the operation**: Parallel processing is a way to speed up operations by performing them concurrently. If the forecasts are independent of each other, you could potentially generate multiple forecasts at the same time using parallel processing. This would require a more complex setup and might not be worth it for smaller datasets, but it could significantly speed up the operation for larger datasets. Here's a basic example using Python's `multiprocessing` module:

from multiprocessing import Pool
def generate_forecasts(num_forecasts):
    with Pool() as p:
        forecasts = p.map(forecast, range(num_forecasts))
    return forecasts
forecasts = generate_forecasts(num_forecasts)

In this code, `Pool().map()` is used to apply the `forecast` function to each element in the range, effectively creating `num_forecasts` forecasts. The forecasts are generated in parallel, which can be faster than generating them one at a time if you have a multi-core processor.

Please note that parallel processing can introduce its own complexities and isn't always the best solution. It's best used when the operation is CPU-intensive and can be broken down into independent tasks.
