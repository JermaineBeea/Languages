In Bash (the default shell for many Linux distributions and macOS), you can run two commands one after the other using similar operators to those in Windows Terminal:

1. Using ; (Run regardless of success)
If you want to run two commands one after the other regardless of whether the first command succeeds or fails, you can use the ; operator.

Example:

bash
Copy code
command1; command2
2. Using && (Run if the first command succeeds)
If you want to run the second command only if the first command is successful (returns an exit status of 0), you can use the && operator.

Example:

bash
Copy code
command1 && command2
3. Using || (Run if the first command fails)
If you want to run the second command only if the first command fails (returns a non-zero exit status), you can use the || operator.

Example:

bash
Copy code
command1 || command2
Example Commands
Here are some examples using these operators:

Using ;:

bash
Copy code
echo "This is the first command"; echo "This is the second command"
Using &&:

bash
Copy code
mkdir example_directory && cd example_directory
Using ||:

bash
Copy code
rm non_existent_file || echo "The file does not exist"

Summary
Use ; to run both commands regardless of the first command's success.
Use && to run the second command only if the first command is successful.
Use || to run the second command only if the first command fails.
