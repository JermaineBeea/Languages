Adding a Directory to Your PATH
To execute programs or scripts from any terminal location in Unix-like operating systems (Linux or macOS), you can add a directory to your PATH variable. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Open Your Shell Configuration File
The PATH variable is set in your shell configuration file, which varies by shell:

    For Bash:
        Edit .bashrc:
        nano ~/.bashrc
        Or, for login shells, edit .bash_profile:
        nano ~/.bash_profile

    For Zsh:
    nano ~/.zshrc

Step 2: Add the Directory to PATH
Decide which directory you want to add to your PATH. For example, if you want to add ~/Documents/Languages/C++/Written, add the following line to the end of the file:
export PATH="$PATH:~/Documents/Languages/C++/Written"

Step 3: Save and Exit
In nano, press CTRL + X, then Y to confirm changes, and press Enter to save.

Step 4: Reload Your Shell Configuration
To apply the changes, reload the configuration file:
For .bashrc:
source ~/.bashrc
For .bash_profile:
source ~/.bash_profile
For Zsh:
source ~/.zshrc

Step 5: Verify the Change
To check if the directory was added to your PATH, run:
echo $PATH
You should see your added directory listed.

Step 6: Using the New Path
Now, any executable or script in ~/Documents/Languages/C++/Written can be run from anywhere in your terminal, for example:
compile.sh simple.c

By following these steps, you will have successfully added a directory to your PATH, allowing you to easily run scripts and executables from any terminal session.
